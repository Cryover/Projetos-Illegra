                <p>“The first time that I appeared on stage, it scared me to death. I really didn’t know what all the yelling was about. I didn’t realize that my body was moving. It’s a natural thing to me. So to the manager backstage I said, ‘What’d I do?
                    What’d I do?’ And he said “Whatever it is, go back and do it again.” </p>
